        <h1 class="about_one">Hi, my name is Cesar. If there is anything I cannot fix I could always trust my dog to find the answer! </h1>
        <h2 class="about_two">I recently graduated from Bloc as a Front End Developer. I came in with zero experience in code, but always had a passion to bring projects to life. Sure, there will be times when coding can be frustrating, but there is this unexplained feeling you get when things just work. I am always looking forward to a challenge, so if you have a project in mind, reach out. <br> <br>
        When I am not coding, I help high schoolers in the South Bronx apply for colleges or even training programs/schools. It is to make sure our students have a plan after high school. Other than that I enjoy a good game of pool with friends and enjoy my fair share of hiking. Sadly, my dog is not a big fan of hikes.
